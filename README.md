<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>
I have a Bachelors of Science in Geology from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, and I worked as a Geophysicist in the engineering consulting industry for about 5 years. In that role, I spent most of my time doing field work to collect seismic, resistivty and radar data. I also did some project management towards the end of my career, but ultimately I came to the conclusion that a career in the construction industry was not allowing me to practice the science of geophysics; that is, the technical stuff that I really loved working on as an undergraduate researcher. I like diving into complex problems, forming an understanding of them, and then building a solution. For the first few years of my career, as a newbie to the constrtuction industry, I was fully satisfied in that regard. But 5 years in, I was doing lots of the same jobs over and over again and there was no longer any novelty left to feed my curiosity. It wasn't for me.
</p>

<p>
I decided to turn back to the place where I learned to pick apart problems: computers. I grew up tinkering with Windows XP-era PC's, because my grandpa ran a PC repair business in his home. But there's a great deal of repetitive work to be had in the field of IT theses days, and I already knew that wasn't my jam. I settled on a career in Cybersecurity because it is, at it's core, a live competition between us ethical folks and the hackers. The nature of the threat landscape is ever-changing. I can get behind that.
</p>

<p>
For the last year or so, I've been focusing on the IT basics. I've practiced up on working from the command line, writing python scripts, learning system administration,  studying cybersecurity framworks and attack methodologies, and grappling with the dizzying amount of tools and applications security practitioners deploy to boost their effectiveness against attackers. The volume of "basic skills" in this field is jaw-dropping (great news for a guy who can't stop learning), and so I've settled on an end-goal to provide some direction to my education. I want focus on force-multiplication. Organization of all sizes are all facing the same dilemma: they're drowning in the amount of work required to defend their assets from every possible threat vector. Each of us needs to strike a balance between saving the world, and preserving our sanity. I've seen what burnout does to an organization, so it seems to me that more overtime isn't the final solution (though it can be a solid stop-gap when shit really hits the fan <em>as long as your team has the leftover capacity when the situation calls for it</em>). I want to work on tools and mechanisms to make security teams more effective. Over time, I plan to fill this repository with the fruits of that labor, but for now, it hosts the home labs and projects I've pursued in order to teach myself an entirely new career.
